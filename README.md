# The Lyceum Network

**Your Voice. Your Network. Your AI.**

The Lyceum is an open-source, community-owned, and decentralized communication and compute network. We are building a resilient, privacy-first alternative to the corporate internet. This project is a public commons, not a company.

## Core Principles

* **Open Source:** All software and hardware designs are licensed under the GPLv3. The project is transparent and open to all contributors.
* **Decentralized:** The network is peer-to-peer. There are no central servers, no single point of failure, and no kill switch.
* **Private:** All communication on the network's core mesh layer is encrypted by default using AES256.
* **User-Owned:** The infrastructure is built, owned, and operated by its users.
* **Resilient:** The network is designed to function entirely off-grid, making it ideal for remote areas, emergency communications, and creating a true internet alternative.

## How It Works (The Three Layers)

The network operates on a unique multi-layered architecture:

1. **Access Mesh (LoRa):** The base layer for everyone. A long-range, low-power mesh for text, GPS, and sensor data. This is where you start.
2. **Utility Fabric (Wi-Fi HaLow):** A higher-bandwidth layer for local applications, including the future home of our federated AI and compute resources.
3. **Backbone Link (MURS):** A long-distance radio
