# The Lyceum Network

**Your Voice. Your Network. Your AI.**

The Lyceum is an open-source, community-owned, and decentralized communication and compute network. We are building a resilient, privacy-first alternative to the corporate internet. This project is a public commons, not a company.

## Core Principles

* **Open Source:** All software and hardware designs are licensed under the GPLv3.
* **Decentralized:** The network is peer-to-peer. There are no central servers.
* **Private:** All communication is encrypted by default using AES256.
* **User-Owned:** The infrastructure is built, owned, and operated by its users.
* **Resilient:** The network is designed to function entirely off-grid.

## How It Works (The Three Layers)

The network operates on a unique multi-layered architecture:

1.  **Access Mesh (LoRa):** The base layer for everyone. A long-range, low-power mesh for text, GPS, and sensor data. This is where you start.
2.  **Utility Fabric (Wi-Fi HaLow):** A higher-bandwidth layer for local applications and the home of our federated AI, "Pneuma."
3.  **Backbone Link (MURS):** A long-distance radio link to connect communities and reduce reliance on the traditional internet.

## The Vision: A Sovereign App Ecosystem

The Lyceum isn't just for communication; it's a platform for creation. Our long-term vision includes a complete, user-owned application ecosystem.
* **"Symbolons":** Developers will be able to offer self-contained apps as a "small gift" or "contribution" to the network.
* **"The Agora":** A decentralized, AI-powered app store where users can discover and activate new apps with simple prompts.
* **Pneuma's Protection:** Our network AI, "Pneuma," will automatically vet all apps for safety and efficiency, protecting the commons from malicious actors.
* **Host Your Own:** When you activate an app, it's hosted on your own node. Your investment in hardware is directly rewarded with a faster, more resilient experience.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started: The AI Walkie-Talkie

The best way to join the network is to build our first application: the AI-Enhanced Walkie-Talkie.

1.  **Get the Hardware:** You'll need a LoRa-capable development board. We strongly recommend hardware supported by the [Meshtastic Project](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware).
2.  **Flash Meshtastic:** Follow the excellent Meshtastic documentation to flash the latest firmware onto your device.
3.  **Join the Lyceum Development:** Our immediate goal is to fork the Meshtastic client and build the STT/TTS "walkie-talkie" functionality. All development will happen here.

## How to Contribute

This is a community effort. We need your help!

* **Developers:** Fork this repository! Help us build the AI Walkie-Talkie, the Pneuma compute layer, and the Symbolon app framework.
* **Hardware Hackers:** Design and share schematics for our self-contained "walkie-talkie" device and MURS backbone nodes.
* **Everyone:** Buy a node! The single most important contribution you can make is expanding the physical network.
