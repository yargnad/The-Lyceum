# The-Lyceum
The Lyceum is a user-owned, multi-layered, decentralized communication and compute network designed as a public commons. It leverages a tiered architecture of unlicensed radio technologies (LoRa, Wi-Fi HaLow, MURS) to create a resilient, privacy-first alternative to centralized, corporate-controlled infrastructure.
