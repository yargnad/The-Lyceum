The Lyceum Network
Your Voice. Your Network. Your AI.
The Lyceum is an open-source, community-owned, and decentralized communication and compute network. We are building a resilient, privacy-first alternative to the corporate internet. This project is a public commons, not a company.
Core Principles
Open Source: All software and hardware designs are licensed under the GPLv3. The project is transparent and open to all contributors.
Decentralized: The network is peer-to-peer. There are no central servers, no single point of failure, and no kill switch.
Private: All communication on the network's core mesh layer is encrypted by default using AES256.
User-Owned: The infrastructure is built, owned, and operated by its users.
Resilient: The network is designed to function entirely off-grid, making it ideal for remote areas, emergency communications, and creating a true internet alternative.
How It Works (The Three Layers)
The network operates on a unique multi-layered architecture:
Access Mesh (LoRa): The base layer for everyone. A long-range, low-power mesh for text, GPS, and sensor data. This is where you start.
Utility Fabric (Wi-Fi HaLow): A higher-bandwidth layer for local applications, including the future home of our federated AI and compute resources.
Backbone Link (MURS): A long-distance radio link to connect communities and reduce reliance on the traditional internet.
ðŸš€ Getting Started: The AI Walkie-Talkie
The best way to join the network is to build our first application: the AI-Enhanced Walkie-Talkie.
Get the Hardware: You'll need a LoRa-capable development board. We strongly recommend hardware supported by the Meshtastic Project, such as:
Heltec V3
RAK Wireless Kits
LILYGO T-Echo
Flash Meshtastic: Follow the excellent Meshtastic documentation to flash the latest firmware onto your device. This will get you connected to the base LoRa mesh.
Install the Client: Use the official Meshtastic mobile app for Android or iOS to connect to your device via Bluetooth. You can now send text messages and see other users on the mesh!
Join the Lyceum Development: Our immediate goal is to fork the Meshtastic client and build the STT/TTS "walkie-talkie" functionality. All development will happen here.
How to Contribute
This is a community effort. We need your help!
Developers: Fork this repository! Check the Issues tab for our project roadmap. Submit a pull request to contribute code for the client app, device firmware, or compute node software.
Hardware Hackers: Design and share schematics for our self-contained "walkie-talkie" device. Create and test high-gain antennas for the MURS backbone.
Everyone: Buy a node! The single most important contribution you can make is expanding the physical network. Run a node, test the software, report bugs, help with documentation, and tell your friends.
